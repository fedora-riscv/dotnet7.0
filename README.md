This is the work-in-progress .NET 7.0 package for Fedora. When it's ready, it
will be merged into Fedora proper.

Group). You can find out more about the DotNet SIG at:

# Specification

This package follows [package naming and contents suggested by
upstream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/build/distribution-packaging),
with one exception. It installs dotnet to `/usr/lib64/dotnet` (aka
`%{_libdir}`).

## Updating to an new upstream release

1. Fork the repo.

2. Checkout the forked repository.

    - `git clone ssh://$USER@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/$USER/rpms/dotnet7.0.git`
    - `cd dotnet7.0`

3. Build the new upstream source tarball. Update the versions in the
   spec file. Add a changelog. This is generally automated by the
   following.

    - `./update-release <sdk-version> <runtime-version>`

    If this fails because of compiler errors, you might have to figure
    out a fix, then add the patch in `build-dotnet-tarball` script
    rather than the spec file.

    - `fedpkg local`

5. Fix any errors that come up and rebuild until it works locally. Any
   patches that are needed at this point should be added to the spec file.

# Testing

This package uses CI tests as defined in `tests/test.yml`. Creating a
pull-request or running a build will fire off tests and flag any issues. We have
enabled gating (via `gating.yaml`) on the tests. That prevents a build
that fails any test from being released until the failures are waived.

The tests themselves are contained in this external repository:
https://github.com/redhat-developer/dotnet-regular-tests/
